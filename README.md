# PROJECTS
This repository includes some projects I participated in during my Bachelor's degree.

## Disclaimer 1
Please note that these projects were developed in groups of 2 or 3 participants, including myself.
Thus, not all the work can be directly attributed to myself. Nonetheless, keeping the groups small always helped me have direct or
indirect impact and awareness on all aspects and modules of the projects.

## Disclaimer 2
Please note that the code here included is not of the highest quality regarding its format. It is not meant to reach the standards
of ab industry project (like a package). It rather serves an educational purpose. Consequently, everything here can be improved.
