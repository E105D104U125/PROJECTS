# PROJECTS
This repository includes some projects I participated in during my Bachelor's degree.

Please note that these projects were developed in groups of 2 or 3 participants, including myself.
Thus, not all the work can be directly attributed to myself. Nonetheless, I always had direct or
indirect impact and overall awareness on all aspects and modules of the projects.
