# PROJECTS
This repository includes some projects I participated in during my Bachelor's degree.

## Disclaimer 1
Please note that these projects where developed in groups (~ 2 or 3 participants), which includes other people appart from myself.
Thus, not all the work can be directly attributed to myself. Nonetheless, keeping the groups small always helped me have direct or
indirect impact and awareness on all aspects and modules of the projects.

Please note that the code included here is not of the highest of qualities regarding its format. It is not meant to reach the quality
standards of a industry projects (such as packages), but rather serve an educational purpose. Consequently, everything here can be improved.
